#Summary
- From the informatio we collected we can see that thee shop could be substanable throught the year. The reason for this is the small change in demperature between june in december. The lowest temperature won't get past 70 which isn't a bad temperature. Its not too cold and not too hot. The max you can get for both of them are in the mid 80s which would be a warm feeling with less chills. To make this more detailed i would like to research more on the kind of climate the location is. For example if the climate is dry or if it rains alot. Knnowing this could help be benificail too becuase theres a difference between 70 degrees raining and 70 degrees dry. If you want to comparethis theory look at portland during december and Vegas december. Both places is completely different but there cold feels alot different.
